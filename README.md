# DividendYield-BraveRepo

# Determined Predictors

## Dividend yield and payout ratio
The first step is to look at two key ratios: dividend yield and payout ratio. Dividend yield is the annual dividend per share divided by the current share price. It tells you how much income you can get from investing in a company. Payout ratio is the percentage of earnings that a company pays out as dividends. It tells you how sustainable and flexible the dividend policy is. It also indicates a company's level of maturity. You can compare these ratios across different companies and industries to find out which ones offer higher returns and lower risks.

## Dividend growth rate and consistency
The second step is to look at how fast and how regularly a company increases its dividends. Dividend growth rate is the annual percentage change in dividend per share. It tells you how much the dividend income can grow over time. Consistency is the number of consecutive years that a company has maintained or raised its dividends. It tells you how reliable and stable the dividend policy is. You can use historical data and charts to track these metrics and identify patterns and trends.


## Dividend discount model and valuation
The third step is to use a valuation method called the dividend discount model (DDM). This model estimates the intrinsic value of a share based on the present value of its future dividends. It tells you how much a share is worth based on the expected dividend payments. You can use different assumptions and scenarios to calculate the DDM and compare it with the current market price. This can help you decide whether a company is overvalued or undervalued based on its dividend policy.

## Dividend policy and strategy
The fourth step is to understand the rationale and objectives behind a company's dividend policy. Dividend policy is the set of rules and guidelines that a company follows to determine how much and how often to pay dividends. It reflects the company's financial situation, growth prospects, and shareholder preferences. Dividend strategy is the way a company communicates and executes its dividend policy. It involves choosing the type, amount, frequency, and timing of dividends. You can read the company's annual reports, investor presentations, and press releases to get insights into its dividend policy and strategy.

## Dividend reinvestment and compounding
The fifth step is to consider the option of reinvesting your dividends instead of taking them as cash. Dividend reinvestment is the process of using your dividends to buy more shares of the same company. This can increase your ownership stake and your future dividend income. Compounding is the effect of earning dividends on your reinvested dividends. This can accelerate your wealth creation and your long-term returns. You can use online calculators and tools to estimate the impact of dividend reinvestment and compounding on your portfolio.

## Dividend risk and diversification
The final step is to be aware of the potential risks and challenges associated with dividend investing. Dividend risk is the possibility that a company may cut or suspend its dividends due to financial difficulties, regulatory changes, or strategic shifts. This can reduce your income and lower your share price. Diversification is the strategy of spreading your investments across different companies, sectors, and markets. This can reduce your exposure to specific dividend risks and increase your chances of finding profitable opportunities.

## Liquidity Indicators 
Liquidity ratios are used to determine a company’s ability to pay its short-term debt obligations. 
- Net working capital = current asset - current liabilities ||||
It is a measure of a company’s liquidity and its ability to meet short-term obligations, as well as fund operations of the business. Since the dividend is typically paid within 12 months, the dividend would be classified as a current liability. As you can see in the visual below, when the company records the dividend, current liabilities increase, which cause net working capital to decrease.
- Cash ratio = cash (& cash equivalent) / total current liability ||||
The cash ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with highly liquid assets. Compared to the current ratio and the quick ratio, it is a more conservative measure of a company's liquidity position.

Since companies need liquid assets to be able to pay dividends to shareholders by the end of the fiscal year, the more liquid an asset is, and the more of it is owned by the company (equity) rather than borrowed money, the company would be in a better financial position to pay dividends. 

## Solvency Indicators
A solvency ratio indicates whether a company’s cash flow is sufficient to meet its long-term liabilities and thus is a measure of its financial health. An unfavorable ratio can indicate some likelihood that a company will default on its debt obligations.
- Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Owner or Shareholders’ Equity ||||
The debt to equity ratio tells you how much your business depends on equity versus borrowed money.
- Debts-to-Assets Ratio = Debt/Assets ||||
The debt-to-assets ratio measures a company's total debt to its total assets. It measures a company's leverage and indicates how much of the company is funded by debt versus assets, and therefore, its ability to pay off its debt with its available assets. A higher ratio, especially above 1.0, indicates that a company is significantly funded by debt and may have difficulty meetings its obligations.
- Shareholder Equity Ratio = Total Shareholder Equity / Total Assets ||||
The equity ratio, or equity-to-assets, shows how much of a company is funded by equity as opposed to debt. The higher the number, the healthier a company is. The lower the number, the more debt a company has on its books relative to equity.

Since dividends are to be continuously paid going into the long-term, if a company's long-term financial status (especially in the next fiscal year) looks bad, and the company is relying more on debts than equity, they would have to make a dividend cut. 

## Profitability Indicators
Profitability ratios assess a company's ability to earn profits from its sales or operations, balance sheet assets, or shareholders' equity. They indicate how efficiently a company generates profit and value for shareholders.
- Net profit margin = Net Income / Sales Revenue ||||
Net profit margin is the total amount you keep after taking every expense into account. Net profit margin helps investors assess if a company’s management is generating enough profit from its sales and whether operating costs and overhead costs are under control. It is one of the most important indicators of a company’s overall financial health.
- Gross Profit Margin = (Sales Revenue – COGS) / Sales Revenue ||||
A company's gross profit margin is the money it makes after accounting for the cost of doing business. Your gross profit margin is how much money your business makes per dollar earned, only taking into account COGS.

If the company is not generating sufficient profits, the company might have to make dividend cuts in the next fiscal year, to prioritize paying for its liabilities. This is because dividends are usually paid from the extra cash a company has, and if the company is not generating sufficient profits to pay its short-term and long-term liabilities, it will take its extra cash to pay for those liabilities and not pay as much dividends to the shareholders.


## Cash flow Indicators 
There are 3 main ratios that are associated with cash flow statement, which indicate a company's financial health and their ability to pay out dividends.
- Current liability coverage ratio = Net Cash from Operating Activities / Average Current Liabilities ||||
The current liability coverage ratio tells you how much cash flow you have for a specific period versus how much debt you need to pay in the near future—typically, within one year’s time. A current liability coverage ratio of less than 1:1 shows the business isn’t generating enough cash to pay for its immediate obligations.
- Cash Flow Coverage Ratio = Net Cash Flow from Operations / Total Debt ||||
The Cash Flow Coverage Ratio measures how well you’re able to pay off debt with cash. However, this ratio takes into account all debt, both long term and short term. Cash flow coverage is calculated on a large scale—yearly, rather than monthly. Generally, experts recommend you keep your cash flow coverage ratio above 1.0 to attract investors.
- Cash Flow Margin = Net Cash from Operating Activities / Net Sales ||||
The cash flow margin ratio tells you how much cash you earned for every dollar in sales for a reporting period.

Cash is the most liquid asset a company has, and it helps them pay for their most immediate obligations and long-term debts. Usually, a company pays out dividends from the extra cash they have, but if the company doesn't have sufficient cash and other assets need to be converted into cash by selling them, then that will be problematic because then the company will use that cash to pay for liabilities, and would have to make dividend cuts.
